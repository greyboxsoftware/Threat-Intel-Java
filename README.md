# Threat-Intel-Java
This is the repository for my Threat Intel script that is written in pure java. 

VERSION 0.1

This application does the following 

1. It will ask the user for an IP address and have the user "check" what major threat intelligence sites that he / she would like to search. Once the user presses search the application opens up "x" amount of internet tabs to search the required sites 

2. If the user subscribes to the Anomali ThreatStream service then they can batch search as many IP's they want through the Anomali API system. This tool is great for getting threat intelligence very quickly. 

This application is a continually evolving process and I will continually update the download link below and the version control here on github. Also note that the version number will be listed at the top of the readme file and the version can be found in the option tab of the application. Keeping these in sync will be important to keep up to date with the application. 

You can download the program here for your ease of use
